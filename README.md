# My final project for CIS 1051
My project is two-fold: first, small-scale analysis and visualization of two metadata files that are the result of research I've been doing for a different project here at Temple. And second, make these visualizations publicly accessable on a webpage. 

Video detailing the project:

## Part 1: The initial data analysis and visualization
For almost a year, we have been compiling comprehensive metadata on a list of ~1500 books that have recently been banned in US school libraries. The first part of my project involved organizing, cleaning, and visualizing that data to answer preliminary and exploratory research questions about the nature of book banning (for example: Which publishing houses publish the most banned books?, What genres of books are most often banned?, and are bnned books most likely to be newer or older publications?) This work can be seen in my DataAnalsis script file as a Jupyter Notebook. Using Pandas and MatPlotLib, I organized and cleaned this data and visualized portions of it to create graphs to answer these questions.

## Part 2: Basic web design:
The rest of this Final Project repo contains my HTML script for my GitHub Pages webpage. Following the attached link, a user can view my home page, a page about the project, a page containing my visualizations with captions, and a page with a link to the original data.
