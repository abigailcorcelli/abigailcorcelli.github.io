# My final project for CIS 1051
My project is two-fold: first, small-scale analysis and visualization of two metadata files that are the result of research I've been doing for a different project here at Temple. And second, make these visualizations publicly accessable on a webpage: https://abigailcorcelli.github.io/.

## Part 1: The initial data analysis and visualization
For almost a year, we have been compiling comprehensive metadata on a list of ~1500 books that have recently been banned in US school libraries. The first part of my project involved organizing, cleaning, and visualizing that data to answer preliminary and exploratory research questions about the nature of book banning (for example: Which publishing houses publish the most banned books?, What genres of books are most often banned?, and are bnned books most likely to be newer or older publications?) This work can be seen in my DataAnalsis script file as a Jupyter Notebook. Using Pandas and MatPlotLib, I organized and cleaned this data and visualized portions of it to create graphs to answer these questions.

## Part 2: Basic web design:
The rest of this Final Project repo contains my HTML script for my GitHub Pages webpage. Following the attached link, a user can view my home page, a page about the project, a page containing my visualizations with captions, and a page with a link to the original data. 

## Challenges and acheivements:
While I assumed the data analysis would be the most challenging or time consuming part of this project, the web design component proved to be much more difficult than I had anticipated. I had very ambitious goals for what I might be able to acheive in terms of web design, but my final project is a much more simplified version of that initial vision. I had to work through a big learning curve with using Git Hub and with writing in HTML, which were both completely foreign concepts to me when I started this project and presented many difficulties as I worked through the process. As I realized this steep learning curve with switching coding languages,I adjusted my project plan while maintaining the overaching goals for my project, which include communicating an important social justice issue (book banning) and making information about that topic accessible to a public audience (via a simple webpage). Overall, I'm really proud of what I've been able to create here, and, even though this project is slightly different and more simplified from my original vision, I've learned a lot about setting acheivable project goals and being flexible in problem solving while still keeping sight of big-picture goals.
