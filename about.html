                <p>As a topic at the forefront of American political discourse, book banning in the United States is a complicated and far-reaching social, political, and cultural issue. Infringing on some of our most basic afforded and protected rights, discussions of censorship and information access are frequently harmful and always convoluted, often threatening the representation of diverse and marginalized identities. In an effort to begin uncovering, documenting, and resisting this movement toward censorship, non-profit activism agency PEN America, in their mission to “unite writers and their allies to celebrate creative expression and defend the liberties that make it possible,” has engaged in the curation of a useful index documenting active challenges and bans against books in US public school districts (“About Us”). Through this metadata research and analysis, PEN has worked toward understanding where book bans come from and what might make certain books susceptible to targeting. In the interest of forwarding this effort to include accumulate even more information and expand the reach of that information to a larger audience, this project is interested in askin questions about our contemporary book banning situation. Look through data visualizations and curated data here to better understand book banning, and to ask your own critical questions about inormation access, censorship, and diversity representation in our culture. </p>
