# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I think I would ideally like to create an interactive webpage/digital project site to host some data I've been working with for a research project in the library's Digital Scholars Studio. We have been studying contemporary book banning in the United States and have collected a lot of really interesting metadata on approx. 1,500 individual titles that have been banned or challenged in schools. I'd like to make that metadata more accessible to a public audience, which is one of the overarching goals of the research project. 

Alternatively, I'd be interested in using pandas and other visualization libraries to organize and visualize some of the more messy metadata from that project. I think this will be a much more easily attainable goal with my current skills, and I know it would be useful to have the data more neatly organized, but I don't think it will be as interesting for a final project. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I'm wondering a little about the limitations of web design with the skills I have now. In an ideal world I would like to make a digital project page that is highly interactive (inspired by digital project sites like this: http://tudornetworks.net or this: http://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/2/index , but I'm not sure if the skills I have now would enable me to do that.
