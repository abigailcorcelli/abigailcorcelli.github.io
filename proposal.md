# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Protecting the Pages"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a website that hosts a large collection of metadata on books that are currently banned in US public schools. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will ideally be a highly interactive webpage that is able to read and host data from a csv file. The user will be able to view information about banned books by scrolling and hovering over their desired title on a webpage that depicts a bookshelf of books. This information will include data that PENAmerica, a literacy activism organization, has collected, as well as information collected by our Representation Lab at Temple (sample data here: https://pen.org/banned-book-list-2021-2022/ ). This data includes things like author, publication year, number of bans, and location of bans for approx 1500 unique titles. 

In order to do this, I'll begin by creating a simple webpage that hosts a photo of a bookshelf of banned books. I'll then customize that page so that scrolling over the image at different xy points will display the desired information from the CSV file. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

This project doesn't relate to another class, but it will be very relevant and useful for the research I have been assisting with in our libray's Digital Scholar's Studio and Representation Lab. Making the data we've collected easily accessed and understood by a public audience is one of our primary goals for the overall project, and a webpage certainly will help us to do that. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this project would be an aesthetically pleasing webpage that communicates the basics of our research and hosts our data. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would include more interactive features on that webpage, where a user can engage with the data in a more interesting or entertaining way than just viewing a spreadsheet or list of titles and information.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this project would include very well designed and compelling interactive features (eg. interesting graphics and organization of the data and incorporation of things like maps for geograohic data, images of books, and visualizations). 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'll first need to aquire some more skills in GitHub and basic webpage creation. Once I've done that, I'll need to use my file reading skills to read and organize the large dataset into more useful and meaningful categories. I think the most difficult part of this project will be in designing and executing the user interactive features I am interested in making. I'll need to do a little more research on the limitations of GitHub web design, and I think I'll need to be creative in how I use the skills I've already learned in this class to acomplish these goals.
